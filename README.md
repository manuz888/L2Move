## üöÄ Installation

### macOS
A binary is available in the [releases](https://github.com/manuz888/L2Move/releases/), but since it is **not signed or notarized**, you will need to bypass Gatekeeper to open it. **I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience!**  

1. Download the `.zip` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/manuz888/L2Move/releases/) and extract it.
2. Open **L2Move** by right-clicking on it, choose Open, then confirm when prompted (only required the first time).
3. If macOS prevents **L2Move** from opening, follow these steps:
   - Open **Terminal** and run (replace `<path-to-L2Move>` with the actual location of the app):
     ```sh
     sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "<path-to-L2Move>/L2Move.app"
     ```
   - Then try opening **L2Move** again.


### Windows
The Windows build is **not yet available**, but it will be released in the future. Stay tuned!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
1. **Open L2Move**.
2. **Load the** `.adg` **file** from the **Drum Rack** or a folder containing multiple `.adg` files for batch conversion.
   - You can do this via **copy & paste** or **drag & drop**.
3. **(Optional)** Check the box to choose whether to create the **preset bundle** for Move. Once the preset bundle is created, you can use **Move Manager** to transfer it to your device.
4. **Start the process**.
5. **For batch conversion**, a `report.txt` file will be generated containing details about the processing results.

‚ö†Ô∏è **If no samples are found**:
Try to open the **Drum Rack** in **Live**, save it as a preset, and use that file as source.
